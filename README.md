# End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Project
Practice dataset (Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems, 2E, Aurélien Géron). Build a model of housing prices in California using the California census data. This data (California Housing Prices dataset from the StatLib repository based on data from the 1990 California census) has metrics such as the population, median income, median housing price (added a categorical attribute), and so on for each block group in California. Block groups are the smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people).¶ Model should learn from this data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.
